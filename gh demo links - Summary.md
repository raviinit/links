* Professional & Enterprise Experience

Worked on multiple production-grade applications involving dashboards, APIs, payment gateways, HRMS, EDI systems, CI pipelines, 
and third-party service integrations for organizations such as:

ECU Worldwide
Logiware Inc
iMeetCentral
SpectrumIntel
Signum International
Supporting Assets
And few more

- Video demos showcasing Laravel, Bootstrap UI, and core PHP code walkthroughs
- Architecture documents illustrating system design and implementation approaches


Bit more in short:
Developed several projects and applications, including APIs, Payment gateway integrations, 
Google Maps integration, Vehicle/GPS tracking, etc. for Logistics, Gaming, eCommerce, 
Health and Finance domains, also provided solutions and POCs using PHP, Laravel, 
CodeIgniter, Zend, Symfony, Classic ASP, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, etc. technologies 
on non-cloud (dedicated servers) and cloud servers, i.e. Azure, AWS, etc. Migrated and 
configured VMs deployed applications on EC2, Lightsail, etc. cloud platforms. Used Docker 
containers in the most recent companies and used React as the front-end, which consumes 
the developed APIs. Since I have good working knowledge of multiple technologies, 
I can support and/or enhance the applications as per the requirements. I am a quick learner 
and can understand the system easily for any development.
