✅ **End-to-End Ownership** – From database design to UI implementation and deployment

Developed several projects and applications, including APIs, Payment gateway integrations, Google Maps, Vehicle/GPS tracking, etc. for Logistics, 
Gaming, eCommerce, Health and Finance domains, also provided solutions and POCs using PHP, Laravel, CodeIgniter, Zend, Symfony, Classic ASP, 
JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, etc. technologies on non-cloud (dedicated servers) and cloud servers, i.e. Azure, AWS, etc. Migrated and configured VMs 
deployed applications on EC2, Lightsail, etc. cloud platforms. Used Docker containers in the most recent companies and used React as the front-end, 
which consumes the developed APIs. Since I have good working knowledge of multiple technologies, I can support and/or enhance the applications as per 
the requirements. I am a quick learner and can understand the system easily for any development.
